## Integrated Urban Planning Using Public Transport and Hotel Industry Data

### Overview
This use case leverages data from Abu Dhabi's public transportation system and hotel industry to improve urban planning and enhance the efficiency of public transport services.

### Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system
- Pandas library for data manipulation
- Access to public transportation and hotel industry datasets

### Datasets
- **Public Transportation Dataset**: Contains data on ridership, demographics, and peak hours.
- **Hotel Industry Dataset**: Includes occupancy rates, room rates, and guest demographics.

### Steps to Implement
1. **Load the Datasets**: Use Pandas to load both datasets into your Python environment.
2. **Merge the Datasets**: Align the datasets on a common key, such as 'date', to correlate the data effectively.
3. **Analyze the Data**: Conduct analysis to identify patterns, such as peak transport usage during high hotel occupancy.
4. **Interpret Results**: Use the analytical output to inform urban planning decisions, such as optimizing public transport routes.

### Example Code
The example Python code provided demonstrates how to load the datasets, merge them, and conduct a basic analysis to determine peak transport usage during high hotel occupancy periods.

### Conclusion
By integrating datasets from multiple sectors, urban planners can make informed decisions that enhance service delivery and meet the demands of both residents and tourists efficiently. This approach supports sustainable urban development and improves the overall quality of life in Abu Dhabi.
